The trim provides a boxy look on the sides of the carport.\n\n![img-79.jpeg](img-79.jpeg)\nL Trim: L-Trim is used as decoration on the ends of regular style carports to provide a finished look. L-trim is also used around the edges of garage doors and on portions of the Box-Eve model carports.\n\n![img-80.jpeg](img-80.jpeg)\nHat Channels: Are installed on vertical buildings. They are used to secure panels to the roof, sides and ends of the building.\n\n![img-81.jpeg](img-81.jpeg)\nRidge Cap: is used only on vertical buildings and is installed in the middle of the roof where the panels meet.\n\n![img-82.jpeg](img-82.jpeg)\nTable Ends: A steel panel usually installed horizontally, with the same curve as the bow of the building.

Our rebar anchors are made from this reinforcing bar, and they are approximately 3' long. They have a 5/8\" nut welded onto one end. They are installed through a hole drilled into the base rail, and they secure the building in both ground and asphalt installations.\n\n![img-85.jpeg](img-85.jpeg)\nMobile Home Anchors: Mobile home anchors are used to secure the building in a ground installation only, and are used primarily on certified buildings. They are helical in design.
