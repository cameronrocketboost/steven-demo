# HOW TO PRICE INSULATION

![img-74.jpeg](img-74.jpeg)
EXAMPLE: A-FRAME 18' Wide X 25' Long X 7' Height

![img-75.jpeg](img-75.jpeg)

1. ROOF
Add extra feet to width of roof

|  WIDTH | REGULAR | A-FRAME  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  12' - 22' Wide | 2' Add On | 2' Add On  |
|  24' Wide | 2' 6" Add On | 2' 6" Add On  |

|  34' - 60' Wide |  | 3' Add On  |
|  61' - 70' Wide |  | 10' Add On  |

1. (Width) + (Extra Ft.) = (Answer)
2. (Answer) x (Length) = Square Footage
3. (Square Footage) x ($2.00) = Cost

1. $(18') + (2') = (20')$
2. $(20') \times (25') = 500'$
3. $(500') \times ($2.00) = $1,000.00

2. SIDES

ONE SIDE COST

1. (Length) x (Height) = Square Footage
2. (Square Footage) x ($2.00) = Cost
3. (Cost) x (2) = Both Sides Cost

1. $(25') \times (7') = 175'$
3. $(175') \times ($2.00) = $350.00

BOTH SIDES COST

$350.00 \times 2 = $700.00

3. ENDS

ONE END COST

1. (2') x (18') = 126'
3. $(126') \times ($2.00) = $252.00

1. (2) x (2) = Both Sides Cost

BOTH ENDS COST

$252.00 \times 2 = $504.00

# TESTIMONIALS

## Melissa Fulls

Arrived at 7:05, had the carport up &amp; ready to go in an hour. Crew was professional &amp; did a great job!

## Becky Baird Thermopolis, Wyoming

Awesome workers. Super 24x40 enclosed with 2 garage doors and 2 shop doors and time building was incredibly fast and efficient. I bought the workers to go boxes with Mexican food and tipped them well. I can't thank you enough for the fine work.

## Mrs. Sue Sweetma Board Camp Arkansas

I would like to compliment you on your crew, the four young men that came to install my carport were very polite and professional. I was really amazed at how fast they got the job done and it looks fabulous. I would highly recommend Coast-to-Coast to anyone.
