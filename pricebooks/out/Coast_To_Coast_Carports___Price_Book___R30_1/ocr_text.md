# We Now Offer Insulation!!

## THERMAL BARRIER:
RADIANT BARRIER
VAPOR BARRIER

![img-51.jpeg](img-51.jpeg)

## THERMAL BARRIER:
* Inside layer made of heat-sealed insulating bubbles. Eliminates convection and conduction heat transfers (can represent 25% of all energy loss/gain in your building).

## RADIANT BARRIER:
* The highly reflective surface of metalized foil (made of 99% pure aluminum) and white polyethylene eliminates radiant heat transfers (can represent 75% of all energy loss/gain in your building).

## VAPOR BARRIER:
Combined product material acts as vapor barrier. Protects against condensation and mildew.

## The highly reflective surface provides optimal thermal performance:
* 97% radiant heat reflection
* Acts as a vapor barrier
* Maximize Thermal resistance (R value) without adding significant thickness to the insulation system.
* Helps maintain temperature and humidity distribution of the structure at time of construction
* Can be used on its own, or in conjunction with massinsulation.

## ONLY
## $1.50
## Per Square Foot

## Sources of Heat Loss in an Uninsulated Wall Cavity
In reality, a large portion of heat is gained/lost by radiant means. Radiant insulation reflects heat that is trying to enter your cool living space back out so that it never gets to you. This provides for much cooler buildings in the summer. By the same means, if you use a reflective product facing into the building, you will reflect the heat you produce in the winter back into the building.

## Reflective Insulation = Warmer Winters &amp; Cooler Summers

## Better Alternative
Reflective insulation is a uniquely designed system made from layers of insulating air bubbles encased by a reflective surface. This unique combination delivers a high performance insulating product suitable for all construction and home renovation projects.

## Summer
Reflects heat away from your living spaces, blocks significant heat gain in your house, and cuts air conditioning costs.

## Winter
Reflects escaping heat back towards your living spaces, reducing heat loss, and lowering heat bills.

# TESTIMONIALS

## Melissa Fults

Arrived at 7:05, had the carport up &amp; ready to go in an hour. Crew was professional &amp; did a great job!

## Becky Baird Thermopolis, Wyoming

Awesome workers. Super 24x40 enclosed with 2 garage doors and 2 shop doors and time building was incredibly fast and efficient. I bought the workers to go boxes with Mexican food and tipped them well. I can't thank you enough for the fine work.

## Mrs. Sue Sweetma Board Camp Arkansas

I would like to compliment you on your crew, the four young men that came to install my carport were very polite and professional. I was really amazed at how fast they got the job done and it looks fabulous. I would highly recommend Coast-to-Coast to anyone.
